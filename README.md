DCPU
====

A DCPU emulator, just for fun.

This is based on the 1.1 version of the spec, which I made about a year ago. It seems :)

See `test/index.html` for an example to run.

Use at your own risk. This stuff is just here for reference. There are better and faster emulators out there. My enthousiasm to work on this project kind of died together with the ceasing of releases of new specs... Ohwell.
